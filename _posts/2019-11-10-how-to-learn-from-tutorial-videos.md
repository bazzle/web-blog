If you’re on a journey in software development or any other technical discipline, you’ll find that the importance of finding your own way to learn something quickly and efficiently is as obvious as the sky is blue. But it seems most online tutorials adopt a one size fits all approach. This is how I adapt my learning to suit me. And how I follow tutorials in my own way.

## Why tutorial videos?

I would argue that watching tutorial videos or courses on youtube, linkedin learning, udemy CodeAcademy etc etc is the best way to learn web development. Books are ok for reference, but I don’t think they are a practical medium in this case. Along with online documentation, a lot can get misinterpreted in the written word.

Words don’t always translate well to what you code into an editor. With advances in javascript in the last few years, we’ve seen the code we’re used to getting abstracted often much faster than we can come up with ways to describe it in language.

A lot of documentation is extremely well written, some isn't written well at all. Sometimes only the people who have written the code and early adopters can articulate how it works and how to make it work for you. These people are not copywriters and are often not versed in making copy easy to understand. A lot of online documentation is waffle which you need a degree in computer science to understand.

 Books are for the most part written by people who get paid for what they do, as opposed to contributors. They are more accessible. But publishing cycles have and always will struggle to keep up with the speed that tools and frameworks update.

Nothing beats an experienced dev explaining to you while you watch their code live on screen for you to follow on with. The frequency of "aha moments" are way higher than they would be if you were stuck in a book or reading documentation.

Needless to say I've watched dozens and dozens of tutorials, mainly on youtube and linkedin learning. With some, I've come away more confused about the subject than before, other times I felt like I hadn't absorbed anything.

Thankfully, over time I've developed some methods to make my tutorial learning more valuable and rewarding with more aha moments.

## Art Attack

Most tutorials will have you build a website or app for yourself. In the case of web development this usually involves building a hello world/todo list/calculator (in that order of difficulty). Surely it's better to "learn by doing" this is absolutely true and you will have built an app, you can say you've built an app!

Well, not really. Technically you have, but in reality you have just followed a set of instructions.

If you were a British kid growing up in the 90's, you should know Art Attack. The baby-faced Neil Buchanan would introduce some creation. "Here's one I made earlier" then he'd reach under his table and grab his raw materials -- a used toilet paper tube, always the toilet paper tube, an empty plastic bottle of dish soap, a few matchsticks, a pair of scissors and a Pritt-stick. The child would go nag its mum or dad for the materials and tools, and sit in front of the TV and follow the instructions to make a paper mache potato head.

Most tutorials aren't that different to Art Attack in format, you download a zip with two folders -- the starting files and the finished product. Not to bash Art Attack's ability to bring out the inner creative spirit and gluey fingers in many a 90's child, but you don't really learn much when you're presented with "Here's one I made earlier" finished product and the starting files, of which you just need to follow a set of instructions in a linear way to fill in the gap, and recreate a copy of the finished app.

One example is recently, I followed a tutorial on Linkedin learning explaining how to bring in data from an API using Fetch. I downloaded the project files and followed the tutorial step by step. I finished it pretty quickly, but I was just following instructions without absorbing anything. Filling in the blanks, I learnt nothing!

So how to combat this? How to actually retain what you're learning?

## Don't religiously follow the instructions

It's simple, don't be a perfect student. Be creative and experiment.  If you're instructed to create a function that does something specific in the context of the app, and you think it's cool how it works, then think of something else you can add to the app that uses the same function but processes different data. If a function takes a string as an argument, see what happens if you pass it a number. If it doesn't work, see how you can change the function to process a number. If you're told to delete that function, not needed. Keep it, and continue to play with it using new things you've learned. 90% of the time it can't hurt.

You need to be careful that you don't bite off more than you can chew though. I've been following a Vue beginners tutorial. One of the tasks was to build a simple component with an input field, the value of which gets added to an array which is looped through and displayed underneath. I attempted to take this to the next level by making each array item an object with several properties, defined through a variety of form elements. I used assumptions based on my prior knowledge of vanilla javascript. Things didn't work and soon enough I was trawling Stack Overflow. I abandoned what I was trying to do. But then later in the tutorial I was taught the proper Vue way of doing what I was trying to do.

The moral of that little story is if you're trying something which isn't covered in the tutorial in that point in time, and things aren't working out for you, don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to do it, as it will probably be explained to you later in the tutorial anyway.

Often the "teacher?" of the tutorial will introduce you to a simpler way of doing a thing first. Then later instruct you to delete all that and do it in a cleaner, perhaps more modular way. I'm all on board with that, as you need to know the basic essence of something before you learn how to handle it in a more standard way. But you don't want to get bogged down into the different ways of doing said thing, and forget the simple way which would provide a more explicit source of reference for when you have to revisit the code to find out how it works. Just copy the file with the original implementation so you've still got it for reference. Which leads me to the next point.

## Use your code as reference

Yes, I always find myself going back into a project folder to find some code I created in a tutorial for reference. This can be problematic with some tutorials whereby you need to download a weighty project folder with file names you're not used to. Remember this tutorial is for your benefit so make sure it's easily findable. Within the files create plenty of comments to remind your future self what the code does. As I touched on already, create duplicate files with descriptive suffixes so you can see what explorations you've made.

## Notice the patterns, pause and anticipate how things work

If you're starting to see recurring patterns, that's when you know you're learning. The teacher will say something along the lines of "And like we did before, we can rewrite this code"  Hit pause and try writing it how you think it will work even if you're not at all convinced it's right, there's no harm in giving it a go, and you might surprise yourself. When you get it right, it's a great feeling when you know you're not just on track, but steaming ahead.

Nothing is better when learning when you feel you're "getting it". Often you notice consistent patterns and you can anticipate how something might work before the teacher has explained it. When the teacher does explain it, you can give yourself a well earned back slap and go boast to others how cool this new thing is you're learning and how you're finding it really easy to learn.

It's no surprise that everyone learns differently, it would be naive for me to think that everything I've said would work for everyone, it just worked for me and it may work for you too.
